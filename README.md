Explanation
Reading the CSV file: The pd.read_csv function reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Data transformation: In this example, a new column age_plus_ten is added to the DataFrame, which is age plus 10.
Creating a database engine: The create_engine function from SQLAlchemy is used to create a database engine. In this case, an SQLite database is used.
Loading the DataFrame into the SQL database: The to_sql method of the DataFrame writes the data into a SQL table. The if_exists='replace' parameter ensures that if the table already exists, it will be replaced.


Notes
Replace the csv_file_path with the path to your actual CSV file.
Replace the database_url with the URL of your actual SQL database if you're not using SQLite.
You can modify the transformation step to include any other transformations you need.
