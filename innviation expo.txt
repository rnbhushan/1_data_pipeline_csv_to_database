1. 🎯 Project Overview
Goal: Build an expert-level RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using your in‑house Selenium-based framework, leveraging existing help docs, issue threads, configs, feature files, and step-definitions. The bot will answer user questions with accurate, context-rich responses based on your internal knowledge.

Benefits to Users:

✅ Instant access to setup guides, troubleshooting docs, and config advice

✅ Reliable, up-to-date answers grounded in your framework’s knowledge

✅ Reduced onboarding friction and support costs

✅ Automation of repetitive help and code-base queries

2. 🎛️ Architecture Overview
🔹 RAG Workflow
Indexing – Ingest internal docs, discussion threads, configs, etc., split into chunks, convert to embeddings, store in a vector DB

.

Retrieval – At runtime, embeddings of user query are compared, top‑k relevant info retrieved

.

Augmentation & Generation – Retrieved context is combined with the question and passed to LLM to produce a grounded answer

🔹 Framework Interaction
Chatbot served via a simple web UI (FastAPI + React/Python UI).

Selenium orchestrates ingestion: reads docs/issues, extracts text, and indexes.

Vector DB options: FAISS, Milvus, OpenSearch etc.

3. 🔧 Step‑by‑Step Implementation Plan
📦 Phase 1: Prototype
Select LLM & Vector DB

LLM: base model (e.g., OpenAI GPT‑3.5/4).

Vector store: FAISS (local), or OpenSearch (scalable)

Build Ingestion Script

Use Selenium to fetch internal docs, issue threads, feature files.

Chunk by sentence/config blocks, embed using embedding API, store in DB

Implement RAG Chain

Use LangChain (or self‑built): embed user query, retrieve top‑k chunks, feed to LLM for final answer

Develop Minimal UI & API

FastAPI backend + simple frontend to accept question → return answer.

🚀 Phase 2: Enhance & Secure
Refine Prompting & Session Memory

Enable multi-turn conversations with context/history.

Add Access Controls

Restrict responses based on user roles and content visibility (issues vs. configs). Use tagged embeddings or partitioned vector indices – single agent + ACL filtering

.

Implement Reference Linking

Provide links to source docs/issues in responses.

Add Logging & Analytics

Track queries, results, confidence, and user feedback for iteration.

Security Hardening

Input validation, encrypted vectors/storage, safe network config .

🧩 Phase 3: Testing & Feedback
Unit & Integration Testing

Test retrieval accuracy, response correctness using internal benchmarks.

User Feedback & Tuning

Pilot with developers: gather feedback, optimize retrieval, prompt structure.

This version focuses on Jira REST API integration with a conversational bot to assist QA/test automation teams and developers.

Here’s the complete breakdown for your meeting 👇

📌 Project: Jira Issue Tracker RAG Assistant
🎯 Objective
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that integrates with Jira REST API, enabling users to fetch:

📝 User stories with descriptions and history

📊 Progress updates (status, assignees, workflows)

🔗 Linked test cases and automation results

📅 Sprint & release details

Purpose:
Help developers, testers, and product owners quickly access Jira issue details conversationally without navigating the Jira UI.

[ User Response with links & context ]
🚀 Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)
🔹 Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Vectorization
Connect to Jira REST API

Authenticate using API tokens (OAuth2/Basic Auth).

Fetch issues: user stories, epics, tasks, subtasks, and comments.

Example endpoints:

GET /rest/api/3/search (query issues)

GET /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}

Preprocess Data

Chunk large stories into smaller segments (e.g., summary, description, comments, attachments).

Include metadata: status, assignee, linked test cases.

Embed Data & Store in Vector DB (Qdrant)

Use OpenAI embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) to convert chunks into vectors.

Store vectors with metadata for fast retrieval by ID/keywords.

🔹 Phase 2: RAG Chatbot Development
Design Conversational Agent (LangChain)

Build RAG pipeline:

Query → Embedding → Vector DB Search → Retrieve Top-K Chunks → Pass to GPT-4

Integrate memory for multi-turn conversations.

Use Chain-of-Thought prompting for complex queries (e.g., “Show automation test results for US-123 and its linked defects”).

Backend API (FastAPI)

Expose endpoints:

/ask – accept user queries, return bot answers

/refresh – trigger re-indexing of Jira data

Handle real-time API calls for up-to-date information.

Frontend (Optional)

React.js / Streamlit chatbot UI

Display responses with hyperlinks to Jira issues.

🔹 Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions

Linting, testing, Docker build & push.

Dockerize Application

Containerize FastAPI + LangChain + Qdrant.

Example:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
Deploy

Deploy containers to Kubernetes/ECS/DigitalOcean.

Set up monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana).

=============================================================
Perfect — this is another production-grade AI use case that fits into your innovation pipeline. Let’s design an “AI Meeting Notes Generator for WebEx” step by step, just like we did for the Selenium RAG chatbot and the Jira RAG assistant. This one focuses on voice-to-text transcription, AI summarization, and automated minutes of meeting (MoM) generation 🚀.

Here’s the complete blueprint for your expert-level implementation and meeting-ready documentation:

📌 Project: AI Meeting Notes Generator for WebEx
🎯 Objective
Develop an AI system to automatically:

🔴 Capture audio from WebEx meetings

🗣️ Convert speech to text using AI transcription models

📝 Summarize and generate structured Minutes of Meeting (MoM)

📤 Deliver notes via email, save to Confluence/SharePoint, or integrate into Jira tickets.

🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
🔹 Phase 1: Data Capture & Transcription
Audio Capture from WebEx

Leverage WebEx APIs to record meeting audio/video.

Alternate: run a local client recorder (e.g., OBS) if API limitations exist.

Convert to .wav format for AI models.

Speech-to-Text (Voice Transcription)

Use AI models:

OpenAI Whisper (high accuracy for multi-speaker transcription).

Mozilla DeepSpeech (open-source alternative).

Handle multi-speaker diarization (distinguish who said what).

🔹 Phase 2: Summarization & MoM Creation
Chunk Long Transcripts

Split transcripts into manageable chunks for LLM processing.

AI Summarizer

Use GPT-4 or Claude to:

Summarize key discussion points.

Extract action items, decisions, and owner assignments.

MoM Template Generation

Structure the output as:

👥 Participants: Alice, Bob, …
📝 Summary: …
✅ Decisions:
   - Decision 1
   - Decision 2
🗂️ Action Items:
   - [Owner] Task - Due Date
Generate both detailed and executive summaries.

🔹 Phase 3: Delivery & Integration
Delivery Channels

Email MoM to attendees via SMTP/Exchange API.

Save to SharePoint/Confluence using their APIs.

Optionally create Jira tickets for action items.

Frontend Portal (Optional)

React/Streamlit app for users to:

Upload recordings manually.

Review/edit transcripts and MoM.
